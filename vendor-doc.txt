# Vendor Dashboard Documentation

This document describes the intended behavior and features of the Vendor Dashboard in the backend system. The Vendor Dashboard is designed to provide vendors with the tools and insights necessary to manage their business activities on the platform efficiently.

## Overview
The Vendor Dashboard serves as the central hub for vendors, allowing them to manage their profile, products, and orders, as well as monitor their business performance. It is accessible only to authenticated users with vendor privileges.

## Key Features and Behaviors

### 1. Vendor Profile Management
- **View & Edit Profile:** Vendors can view and update their business information, including business name, contact details, and logo.
- **Profile Image/Logo Upload:** Vendors can upload or update their business logo, which is displayed on their profile and product listings.

### 2. Product Management
- **Create Product:** Vendors can add new products, providing details such as title, description, price, and images.
- **Edit Product:** Vendors can update existing product information and images.
- **Delete Product:** Vendors can remove products that are no longer available or relevant.
- **View Product List:** Vendors can see a list of all their products, with options to search and filter.

### 3. Order Management
- **View Orders:** Vendors can view all orders placed for their products, including order details and customer information.

## Intended User Experience
