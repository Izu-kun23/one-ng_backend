# Project Functionality Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the backend codebase, summarizing the main features and functionalities implemented across all modules.

---

## 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- **User Registration & Login:** Users can register and log in using secure authentication mechanisms (JWT-based).
- **Role-Based Access Control:** The system supports different user roles (e.g., admin, vendor, regular user) with access restrictions enforced via guards and decorators.
- **Current User Context:** Decorators are used to inject the current user context into controllers for personalized actions.

## 2. Admin Functionality
- **User Management:** Admins can view, update, delete, and ban/unban users.
- **Vendor Management:** Admins can view all vendors and approve or reject vendor applications.
- **Product Management:** Admins can view and delete any product on the platform.
- **Order Management:** Admins can view all orders.
- **Analytics:** Admins have access to system-wide analytics, including user, vendor, product, order, and revenue statistics.

## 3. Vendor Functionality
- **Vendor Registration & Profile:** Users can register as vendors and manage their vendor profiles.
- **Product Management:** Vendors can create, update, and manage their own products, including uploading images.
- **Order Management:** Vendors can view and manage orders related to their products.

## 4. Product Functionality
- **Product Listing:** Products can be created, updated, listed, and deleted. Each product can have multiple images and is associated with a vendor.
- **Product Search & Filtering:** Products can be queried with various filters for efficient searching.

## 5. Order Functionality
- **Order Creation:** Users can place orders for products.
- **Order Status Updates:** Orders can be updated (e.g., confirmed, shipped, delivered) by authorized users (vendors/admins).
- **Order Listing:** Orders can be listed and filtered by users, vendors, and admins.

## 6. Messaging Functionality
- **User Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages within the platform.
- **Message Listing:** Messages can be listed and filtered for each user.

## 7. File Uploads
- **Image Uploads:** The system supports uploading images for user profiles, vendor logos, and product images, leveraging a cloud storage service (e.g., Cloudinary).
- **File Validation:** Uploaded files are validated for type and size.

## 8. Common Utilities
- **Guards & Interceptors:** Custom guards and interceptors enforce security, logging, and request/response transformations.
- **Pipes:** Validation pipes ensure data integrity for incoming requests.

## 9. Database & ORM
- **Prisma ORM:** The backend uses Prisma for database access, migrations, and schema management.
- **Migrations:** Database schema changes are managed via migration files.

## 10. Testing
- **E2E Testing:** End-to-end tests are provided to ensure the reliability of core features.
